#' Import the official ClinVar flat reports as one tidy table
#'
#' Joins `variant_summary` and `submission_summary` directly in DuckDB. The
#' resulting `clinvar` table has one scalar row per variation, allele, assembly
#' location, decision, SCV submission, RCV accession, or allele-gene link,
#' identified by `record_kind`. It is the same canonical table used by
#' [rclinvarbitration_import_xml()].
#' Location rows retain source coordinates even when ClinVar does not provide a
#' complete VCF tuple (for example some CNVs). `clinvar_vcf` contains only
#' locations with a usable one-based position and non-missing REF/ALT.
#'
#' This is the compact default substrate for ClinVarbitration and temporal
#' analysis. XML import remains available for evidence absent from the flat
#' reports, including richer attributable observations and XML-only text.
#'
#' @param con A DuckDB DBI connection.
#' @param submission_path Official `submission_summary*.txt.gz`.
#' @param variant_path Official `variant_summary*.txt.gz`.
#' @param release_id Immutable source-release label stored with the imported
#'   rows and returned in the import receipt.
#' @param parquet_path Optional new Parquet path for the same tidy table. The
#'   returned import receipt can be passed directly to
#'   [rclinvarbitration_publish_ducklake()].
#' @param assembly One or both of `"GRCh38"` and `"GRCh37"`. Both are imported
#'   by default; policy decisions are computed once, preferring GRCh38 as the
#'   coordinate source when both are present.
#' @param profile_id Policy profile recorded on decision rows.
#' @param submitter_exclusions Submitters excluded from the policy decision.
#' @return Invisibly returns the table name, release identity, source paths and
#'   byte sizes, and row counts by record kind.
#' @export
