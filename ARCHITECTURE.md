# duckclinvarbitration architecture

The standalone DuckDB C extension in `src/` exposes
`clinvar_xml_entities`, `rclinvar_json_field` and
`rclinvarbitration_pubmed_xml_rows` to any DuckDB client. Its pinned headers
are in `duckdb_capi/`; its SQL tests are in `test/sql/`. It performs forward
XML scanning, not schema creation, download or publication. The R front end
in `r/RClinVarbitration/` stages these C sources with `bootstrap.R`, then
builds version-specific package artifacts using host libxml2 and zlib.

RClinVarbitration owns ClinVar source facts, release identity, disease/allele
arbitration, and source XML ingestion/publication for literature linked to
clinical interpretation.

- The scalar `clinvar` relation and its release catalogue are the ClinVar
  source authority. Tidy Parquet retains `release_id`; DuckLake publication
  validates that identity, policy, profile, and keys.
- The pinned ClinVarbitration policy is evaluated at disease and allele grain.
  `rclinvarbitration_disease_release_transitions()` compares two imported
  releases under one configured profile; it is a selection relation, not a
  case-ranking or metric surface.
- The standalone libxml2 DuckDB extension contains concrete forward
  scanners for ClinVar VCV XML and PubMed baseline/update XML. The tested
  PubMed shapes are `PubmedArticle`, `PubmedBookArticle`, and multi-PMID
  `DeleteCitation`. PMID is article authority; DOI and PMCID are identifiers;
  citation identifiers retain their reference ordinal. Imports append scalar,
  source-versioned `pubmed_*` facts in the selected DuckDB or DuckLake catalog.
  `pubmed_sources.source_ordinal` is typed application order;
  `pubmed_current_*` and `pubmed_*_as_of(source_id)` select effective visible
  facts without erasing deletion-hidden history. `source_provider` and snapshot
  identity remain separate from article identifiers and future provider
  provenance. The read-only `pubmed_literature_snapshots`,
  `pubmed_literature_article_versions`, and `pubmed_literature_sections` views
  are the canonical all-version handoff to ducksemantics: the sections view
  emits title rows as `section = 'title'` and abstract rows as
  `section = 'abstract'`, preserving structured PubMed labels in `subsection`.
  This package owns source identity and temporal facts; ducksemantics consumes
  those relations for retrieval/grounding without a dependency, cache, or
  shadow copy.
- Europe PMC is the next concrete enrichment/fetch source. It is not
  implemented here: full text is demand-driven for shortlisted articles, never
  a baseline-wide ingest. Unmodeled PubMed DTD elements are not projected as
  facts; the package makes no full-DTD coverage claim.

Boundaries are deliberate: ducksemantics owns semantic retrieval and
grounding; VariantStory owns case policy and ranking; VariantStoryBench owns
evaluation. This package does not add semantic screening, provider object
hierarchies, generic XML frameworks, metric summaries, cache/checksum/ledger
frameworks, Python/model dependencies, or nested source receipts.
